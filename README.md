Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Sage and I am a self-taught programmer from New Brunswick, Canada! I have experience in a wide variety of programming languages across multiple development domains. My primary passion is game development but I also have a strong background in web, particularly with NextJS. For the last few years I have also worked as a part-time programming instructor, teaching students how to make games with Java, Python, C++, and more.
