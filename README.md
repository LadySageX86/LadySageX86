Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Sage and I am a self-taught programmer from New Brunswick, Canada! I have experience in a wide variety of programming languages across multiple development domains. My primary passion is game development but I also have a strong background in web, particularly with NextJS. For the last few years I have also worked as an instructor with Real Programming 4 Kids, a Toronto-based organization that provides programming classes to youths of all ages and skill levels.
